# Parallel Computing with MPI and OpenMP in C

## Overview
This project showcases the implementation of parallel computing techniques using both the Message Passing Interface (MPI) and OpenMP in C programming. The project covers solving linear equations using iterative methods like Conjugate Gradient, Successive Over-Relaxation (SOR), and Jacobi, as well as simulating a 3D scalar field theory in parallel.

## Linear Equation Solvers
The linear equation solvers project demonstrates the parallel implementation of Conjugate Gradient, SOR, and Jacobi methods. These methods solve large systems of linear equations efficiently using MPI and OpenMP.

## Scalar Field Simulation
The scalar field simulation project focuses on simulating a 3D scalar field theory in parallel. It employs both MPI and OpenMP to distribute the computation across multiple processes or threads, allowing for faster simulation.
